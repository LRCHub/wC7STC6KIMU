Yeah, they call me Mr. Saturday night
Mr. Always in
Mr. Never missed a good time
Yeah, I smoke and drink
Smile and wink
And make 'em think I'm fine
They don't know how much
I missed her Saturday night
They think that I'm the life of this whole bar
But if she walked in my act would fall apart
So, I buy a round and shut it down and never leave alone
But when Sunday comes, they get up and they go
That's why they call me Mr. Saturday night
Mr. Always in
Mr. Never missed a good time
I hear them say, I'm jealous of that guy
But they've only seen me in a neon light
Yeah, I smoke and drink
Smile and wink
And make 'em think I'm fine
They don't know how much
I missed her Saturday night
There was a time when I had everything
The kind of beautiful you only see in your dreams
But I messed it up and I'm the only one to blame
I guess losing her is how I earned my name
Yeah, they call me Mr. Saturday night
Mr. Always in
Mr. Never missed a good time
I hear them say, I'm jealous of that guy
But they've only seen me in a neon light
Yeah, I smoke and drink
Smile and wink
And make 'em think I'm fine
They don't know how much
I missed her Saturday night
Yeah, I turn it on
But all alone
I'm going out of my mind
They don't know how much
I missed her Saturday night
